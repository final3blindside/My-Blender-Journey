        I started learning Blender through Youtube, courtesy of Blender Guru, "Blender 3.0 Tutorial Series"
        Donut Tutorial. Today marks the beginning of my blog, and hopefully, it inspires people to do the same.

        I may have met a deadline, a bummer stop. I have found Github Student Developer Pack, and also accessed Microsoft for Students. I have tools that are really useful for me as I am self-learning Web Development. Last Friday, I joined the Meet for StackLeague Volunteers. I met a fellow freshman self learning web dev, but she has more experience than me. I want that same experience.
